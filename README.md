# Computer Infrastructure Project: Assessment Problems

By Stephen Kerr

## Purpose of this Repository 
This Repository contains my sumission for the assessments for the Module Computer Infrastructure for my HDIP in Computing and Data Analytics. 

The purpose of this assessment is to allow me to demonstrate my achievement of the module learning outcomes.  

The aim of the **Computer Infrastructure** module is to enable students to demonstrate their ability to:
>1. Use, configure, and script in a command line interface environment.
>2. Manipulate and move data and code using the command line.
>3. Compare commonly available software infrastructures and architectures.
